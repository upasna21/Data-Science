Java Basics -3! Garbage collection--no bad addresses! Array and string bounds checking! No jumping to bad method addresses! Interfaces and exceptionsJava Program StructureA file containing Java source code is considered a compilation unit. Such acompilation unit contains a set of classes and, optionally, a package definition togroup related classes together. Classes contain data and method members thatspecify the state and behavior of the objects in your program.Java programs come in two flavors:! Standalone applications that have no initial context such as a pre-existing mainwindow! Applets for WWW programmingThe major differences between applications and applets are:! Applets are not allowed to use file I/O and sockets (other than to the hostplatform). Applications do not have these restrictions.! An applet must be a subclass of the Java Applet class. Aplications do not need tosubclass any particular class.! Unlike applets, applications can have menus.! Unlike applications, applets need to respond to predefined lifecycle messagesfrom the WWW browser in which they're running.Java Program ExecutionThe Java byte-code compiler translates a Java source file into machine-independent byte code. The byte code for each publicly visible class is placed in aseparate file, so that the Java runtime system can easily find it. If your programinstantiates an object of class A, for example, the class loader searches thedirectories listed in your CLASSPATH environment variable for a file called A.classthat contains the class definition and byte code for class A.There is no link phase for Java programs; all linking is done dynamically at
